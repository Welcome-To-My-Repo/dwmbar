This is a utility to provide system information to the taskbar in
Suckless.org's DWM.

This program comes with no guarantees and definitely will have
unexpected behavior outside of DWM.

Configuration is done by editing dwmbar_config.h. There's no need to
bother with the other source files unless drastically different
behavior is desired.

The DISPLAY string sets how dwmbar displays the system information.
The functions used to get system information are called by their name
inside a set of Grave Accents (Grave Accent = ` ). Any other notation
including white space is entered normally inside the string quotes.

The following functions are available for use. Each return only number
with no other notation or formatting (excepting the DATE_TIME
function which has it's own formatting setting).

MEM
	gives the amount of RAM currently used in a number of kB.

CPU
	gives the average CPU usage across all cores in a percentage

PROCESSES
	gives the number of processes currently running

BATTERY_state
	gives the state of the battery i.e. "charging", "full", etc...

BATTERY_charge
	gives the level of charge left in the battery in a percentage

DATE_TIME
	gives the date and/or time depending on the formatting in
	DATE_DISPLAY
