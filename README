This is a utility to provide system information to the taskbar in
Suckless.org's DWM.

This program comes with no guarantees and definitely won't work
correctly outside of DWM.

Configuration is done by editing dwmbar_config.h. There's no need to
bother with the other source files unless drastically different
behavior is desired.

The following are descriptions of the available information that
dwmbar can display.

The memory load is displayed as an amount in kilobytes.
